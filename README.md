## Get started
Before running PoG, please ensure you have successfully installed **Freebase** on your local machine. The comprehensive installation instructions and necessary configuration details can be found in the `/Freebase/README.md`.

The required libraries for running ToG can be found in `requirements.txt`. You must use your own API in the run_LLM function of utils.py for the APIs.

To set up the environment, install the required dependencies using:

```bash
cd PoG
```

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


## Running the Dataset for Single-Keyword Questions

Use the following command to run the dataset for single-keyword questions:

```bash
python PoG_single.py <Dataset_name> <sum/unsum> <beam_search:1, 12, 13, 123> <PoG/PoGE> <gpt3/gpt4> <max_depth 1/2/3>
```

### Arguments:
- `<Dataset_name>`: The dataset to use. Options:
  - `webqsp`
  - `cwq`
  - `grailqa`
  - `webquestions`
  - `simpleqa`
- `<sum/unsum>`: 
  - `sum` for using path summary
  - `unsum` for not using summary
- `<beam_search>`: Beam search strategy:
  - `1` for only using fuzzy selection
  - `12` for step1 + BranchReduced
  - `13` for step1 + precise selection
  - `123` for using all steps
- `<PoG/PoGE>`:
  - `PoG` for using all relations
  - `PoGE` for using a random single relation
- `<gpt3/gpt4>`:
  - `gpt3` for using GPT-3
  - `gpt4` for using GPT-4
- `<max_depth>`: Maximum search depth:
  - `1` for using only 1-hop
  - `2` for using 2-hop
  - `3` for using 3-hop

### KG usage:
PoG utilze the Freebase KG. For more details about Freebase installation, please refer to the Freebase folder.

## Running the Dataset for Multi-Keyword Questions

Use the following command to run the dataset for multi-keyword questions:

```bash
python PoG_multi.py <Dataset_name> <sum/unsum> <beam_search:1, 12, 13, 123> <PoG/PoGE> <gpt3/gpt4> <max_depth 1/2/3>
```

### Arguments:
The arguments are the same as those for `PoG_single.py`.

### Subgraph Loading:
PoG_multi will load the subgraph at maximum depths first from KG as the database preparation. The loading time depends on the environment setup and memory allocated for the freebase server.

### KG usage:
PoG utilze the Freebase KG. For more details about Freebase installation, please refer to the Freebase folder.
## Checking the Answer

Use the following command to check the answer:

```bash
python check_answer.py <Dataset_name> <sum/unsum> <beam_search:1, 12, 13, 123> <PoG/PoGE> <gpt3/gpt4> <max_depth 1/2/3>
```

### Arguments:
The arguments are the same as those for `PoG_single.py`.

## Notes
- Ensure that the dataset files and model configurations are correctly set up before running the scripts.
- Use appropriate depth values based on the complexity of the dataset and required accuracy.
- Experiment with different beam search strategies to find the optimal balance between speed and accuracy.

For any issues, please refer to the error messages or modify the script parameters accordingly.
